It will take about 75 mins to finish this experiment. <br /> Please use a headphone while completing the task if you can. Please adjust your volume to a comfortable sound level. <br />You will begin with a questionnaire asking about your listening devices and how noisy your current environment is.</p>",center,LandingWelcome,,,

text,"<p> Below are my final reminders. <br /><br /> (1) Use your keyboard to respond instead of using your mouse. <br />(2) DON'T THINK. Follow your first intuition to make response ASAP. You cannot get it correct by thinking. <br />(3) The total time will depend on your response time, so try to respond as correct and fast as possible. <br />(4) This task is HARD, and thus requires your undivided attention, so please put away your phone or other distractors whlie doing this experiment. <br /><br /> That's all I have for you. Please try your best! Good luck.</ p>",center,Instruction_main,,,
